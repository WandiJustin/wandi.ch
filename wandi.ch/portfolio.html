            <p class="p-port">Creating websites has and always will be on my To-Do List. I started making my own websites when I was
                like 10 years old.</p>
            <p class="p-port">Most of them were made with Jimdo and weren't 'programmed' by myself. This changed with the last couple
                of websites. My website for my class was my graduation project for secondary school. I've worked on that
                for some days and hosted it under the domain 'klasse3c.ch'. Just a heads up it isn't online since summer
                2021.</p>
            <br>
            <p class="p-port">My last self-'coded' website is 'wandi.ch'. I've worked on this site a while and even tried to host it on
                my own, which I haven't done because of security risks. The plan for this website is that I'm going to
                try new things out on it and also try to update the about me and portfolio section as time continues.
                JavaScript is hopefully going to be part of this website in the near future.

            <p class="p-port">YouTube is a side-project of mine since I was 8 years old. I started first with recording the TV or my
                very first computer with my iPhone 3G while playing COD Black Ops 2 or Minecraft. I started editing the
                videos a bit later in Windows Movie Maker. After that, I upgraded to recording my videos with Fraps and
                editing them in Camtasia 8. And since about 2018 I'm working with OBS and Adobe Premiere Pro and After
                Effects. I'm mostly working with Adobe Premiere Pro now because I don't really need editing software for
                Effects anymore.</p>
            <br>
            <p class="p-port">I've gone through multiple channels. First was Wandi007 my very first account but I took those videos
                private out of concern for those who may watch those videos. After that, I made the channel Mashed
                Potatoes witch later was renamed Animedix. Animedix was a project with one of my best friends Samuel or
                also known as Koezan. My latest project is the channel Wandi, where I record me and my friends
                playing video games and I later cut them in the style of the famous YouTuber 'Soviet Womble'.</p>
