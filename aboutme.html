            <p class="p-aboutme">Ola, I'm Justin or better (more like worse) known as Wandi. I was born on the 14th of
                February in 2005 and most likely younger than anyone reading this. I'm doing an apprenticeship at one of
                the larger supermarket companies in Switzerland. Oh yea, I live in Switzerland, Lucerne. Even though,
                I'm doing this apprentice at a supermarket chain, I work in IT. Why IT? 'Cause I'm too retarded for
                anything else.
            </p>
            <p class="p-aboutme">I've already worked on smaller projects. Everything most likely started with Minecraft,
                where I had to put up a server. And after that I somehow started liking the hellscape that is known as
                IT. Most of the games that I made were made with GameMaker Studio or Unity, nothing impressive because
                everything was done with tutorials. But still, I somehow managed to get a pretty good knowledge of IT.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p class="p-aboutme">At the moment I have a basic understanding of C, know a bit C#, and also worked one
                time with JavaScript. Through a course and some training, I was able to learn HTML and CSS Basics and
                make working and more or less good-looking Websites. The apprenticeship I'm doing and hopefully
                finishing in 2024 is as an IT system technician. As I don't know if that's a known term in English, it
                basically means maintenance, support, and installation of various IT-systems.
