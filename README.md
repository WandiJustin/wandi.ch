My personal website. Here I'll uploadingchangelogs and the source files

🎃This is a learning journey for me. I've made websites but that was a few years ago. Also I want to try to make it fully responsive. 
   I've only done websites for clubs of mine or school-classes, not for my personal use. 

🥸 As soon as a new version of the site goes online or I've made a major change I'll upload it to GitHub.
