            <h1>History</h1>
            <p class="p-aboutme">
                The channel "Animedix" was one of the longest projects I was working on.
                I've stopped working on this channel in early 2019. The start of this channel was on the 22.11.2014.
                I was heavily into AMVs and Video game Edits at the time and wanted to create such videos myself which
                I made.
                <br>
                I've worked with various games, programs, plugins, presets and series.
            </p>
            <h1>How to create a video</h1>
            <p class="p-aboutme"> I tried to create a more visual appealing look. I was way more focused on filters and
                effects. Most parts of the video were from game trailers combined with footage from me while I was
                playing or footage from various series.
                <br>
                I used recording software to record my footage. My main tool is the Open Broadcaster Software, in which
                I
                will
                collect the game session. I first started using OBS with this channel and worked with it since and used
                various plugins.
                <br>
                After collecting the footage, trailers and or series I will edit those together to a series of clips
                in Premiere Pro. In Premiere Pro I try to match the clips to my selected music.
                I will export that into After Effects and use various motion FX and filter plugins to make the visuals
                more appealing.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h1>Apperance</h1>
            <p class="p-aboutme">
                I didn't really have a theme for this channel. I worked closely with a close friend of mine <a
                href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfp4naFsVsXzNORqxpHrVpQ">Koezan</a> for most of my decisions
                on appearance.
                He influenced this channel heavily. A theme that was almost there from the start was a (broken) heart.
                It's in the beginning and end of a video, and also in the channel avatar and banner.
            </p>
            <h1>What I'm proud of</h1>
            <p class="p-aboutme">
                My work wasn't very consistent. I had many favorites and many videos that I'd like to delete. One of my
                favorites are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKuLnewRDgQ">"[ONE SHOT - NEFFEX] Battlefield V
                Edit"</a> or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9nLUSzwYsM">[I love her] Cs:Go Edit by
                Wandi</a> first of which
                is embedded on the top. Both were very fun to make, and I learned alot working on these two. Also, I
                really
                like the
                end products.
