            <h1>History</h1>
            <p class="p-aboutme">"Wandi" is my newest YouTube Channel and the only one that I'm still activly working
                on. I've created the channel on the 18.03.2016.
                But started really working on it in 2019. I've uploaded my first video on the channel in 2019. I've
                played the game Left 4 Dead with Koezan (Samuel) and Flowey. After that video I've uploaded more and
                more videos.
                Until recently, since then I'm trying to upload atleast one video a month.
            </p>
            <h1>How to create a video</h1>
            <p class="p-aboutme"> The point of editing the video is to cut together the funniest clips of me and my
                friends gaming and then putting a layer of text under it. The gameplay is recorded while I'm streaming
                on <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/WandiTV">Twitch</a> or just casually playing some video games.
                <br>
                I use 2 softwares to record my footage. My main tool is the Open Broadcaster Software in which I will
                collect the whole session. And the second tool is "Medal", with Medal I can click my mouse button and
                the last 5 minutes of my session will be recorded.
                <br>
                After collecting the footage I will edit those sessions or clips of the session together in Adobe
                Premiere Pro.
                Here most of the magic is done. I use the normal text-tool of Premiere Pro and use the Font "Keep Calm"
                with an border.
                All of the moving text is made with frame-for-frame set positions (keyframes). I export the endproduct
                in H.264 and upload that onto my channel.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h1>Apperance</h1>
            <p class="p-aboutme">
                The apperance of the youtube channel itself was mostly made with Photoshop.
                I used photoshop to cut the profil picture, watermark and other pictures to the right size.
                The banner was also made with basic photoshop and wasn't that big of a deal. I went for a rather clean
                look than something to overloaded.
                I think the videos are already to much chaos so why should the channel be that. But I still love the
                Vaporwave-Style and so I wanted to integrate that into the banner.
                I don't do thumbnails. I take the best one that youtube gives me to choose from when the video is
                finished uploading.
            </p>
            <h1>What I'm proud of</h1>
            <p class="p-aboutme">
                I'm pretty satisifed with the videos made in late 2021 and early 2022. I've checked them more sincearly
                and don't have to many mistakes in them.
                But I'm espacially proud of my EscapeFromTarkov video. The one you see at the top of the page. This
                video is my alltime favorite and I'm a bit sad that it was recorded in Swiss-German rather than German.
